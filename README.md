# EliminatingLeftRecursionInBNFGrammar

➡️ The main purpose of the project is to parse a specific syntax defined in the input file (.y file) and generate an output that transforms any left-recursive grammar rules into an equivalent non-left-recursive form.


➡️ The associated makefile provides instructions for building the project, including the compilation of lex.yy.c and y.tab.c files.
